This folder contains two function files:
(1) AAJ.m - contains the main AAJ function
(2) AndersonMixing_AAJ.m - contains the Anderson update function called by AAJ.

It also contains two .mat files with sample matrices and right hand side vectors (one for periodic Poisson and other for periodic Helmholtz).

Running the code:
(1) Load one of the .mat files that has a matrix (A) and the right hand side vector (b).
(2) Specify the initial guess vector (eg: x_guess=ones(size(b));) and convergence tolerance (eg: tol=1e-8;) in the command window of MATLAB.
(3) Run the code as:
       x = AAJ(A,b,x_guess,tol); % solves Ax=b

NOTE: Modify the "Input Parameters" in AAJ.m for optimizing the performance for the chosen problem
