Instructions to run the AAR_Complex code:
This code is for solving complex-valued systems of equations using the AAR method, with the complex-valued Helmholtz 
equation provided as an example. 

(1) Modules required to compile the code:intel/15.0, mvapich2/2.1, fftw/3.3.4, mkl/11.2, petsc/3.5.4-complex

(2) Compile the code by typing "make" in the root directory $AAR_petsc.
    
(3) Input file  :    "test.in" 
    Output file :    "test.out" - prints number of processors used, input parameters, time taken by the solver.

(4) Parameters in the input file:
    aar_pc - 0 or 1 indicates use of Jacobi or Block-Jacobi preconditioning respectively
    solver_tol - convergence tolerance for the solver
    m_aar - AAR solver parameter (history)
    p_aar - AAR solver parameter (frequency of Anderson extrapolation, if p_aar=1, then it is AR)
    beta_aar - AAR solver parameter (relaxation)
    
(5) Running the code: (e.g. for 64 processors)

           mpirun -env MV2_ENABLE_AFFINITY=1 -env MV2_CPU_BINDING_POLICY=bunch -n 64 ./AAR -name test -log_summary>test.out
	   
(6) The executable (AAR) is created in the root directory and the source code is in the file named AAR_Complex.cc.
