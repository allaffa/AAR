PETSC Library:

1) .h files inside 'arch-linux2-c-debug/include' subdirectory have been moved 
   to 'include' subdirectory.


Codes.tar.gz:

1) This compressed directory contains the original codes sent to me by 
   Phanish Suryanarayana.
   Some modifications have been made in the 'makefile'. For instance, 
   the object file was said to be built upon the source file 'AAR.c'. 
   This name is incorrect, since it should be 'AAR.cc'. 
   Moreover, Library paths have been changed to compile the code on 
   the machine 'euler' in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science 
   at Emory University.
